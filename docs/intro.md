# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — A Modern Technical Guide

Welcome to "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — A Modern Technical Guide." This book is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of the exciting and rapidly evolving fields of physical artificial intelligence and humanoid robotics. Whether you are a student, researcher, hobbyist, or professional, this guide will walk you through the fundamental concepts, advanced technologies, and practical applications that define the next generation of intelligent machines.

## What This Book Covers

This book is divided into four main chapters, each building upon the last to provide a complete picture of modern humanoid robotics.

### Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI
This chapter introduces the core concepts of Physical AI, distinguishing it from purely cognitive or software-based AI. We explore the essential systems of perception, manipulation, and locomotion, and we look at real-world examples of advanced robots like the Tesla Bot, Boston Dynamics' Atlas, and Figure 01, which are pushing the boundaries of what is possible.

### Chapter 2: Humanoid Robotics Fundamentals
Here, we dive into the fundamental hardware and software that make up a humanoid robot. We cover the anatomy of humanoids, including sensors, actuators, and motors, and discuss the critical challenges of balance and bipedal locomotion. You will also get an introduction to the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2), a foundational software framework, and learn about power systems, battery management, and joint structures.

### Chapter 3: AI Models for Humanoid Behaviors
This chapter focuses on the artificial intelligence models that drive humanoid behaviors. We explore advanced topics such as Vision AI for navigation (SLAM, object detection, and depth sensors), motion planning for generating smooth and precise movements, and the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable natural language control. We also cover reinforcement learning techniques for training robots and discuss the importance of robust safety systems.

### Chapter 4: Building a Simple Humanoid Prototype
In the final chapter, we bring together all the concepts in a practical guide to building a simple humanoid prototype. We provide guidance on hardware selection, including servos, frames, and microcontrollers like the ESP32 and Arduino. You will learn the basics of 3D printing for creating custom parts and see a servo control example. Finally, we outline a roadmap for integrating AI into your prototype, giving you a clear path forward.
